📌 Introduction

The Personal Fortune Generator is a console-based fortune-telling program
written in MASM assembly (Irvine32 / 32-bit).

By entering three personal data fields:

English Name

Birthday

Zodiac Sign

The system generates a unique hash value, converts it to a binary string,
and uses it to map to a personalized fortune.

The user then chooses which type of fortune they want:

愛情運勢 (Love)

學業運勢 (Study)

健康與財運 (Health & Wealth)

Each category contains 24 unique fortunes, separated into eight levels
(大吉 / 中吉 / 小吉 / 吉 / 末吉 / 凶 / 小凶 / 大凶),
with 3 variations per level.

This makes a total of 72 fortunes in the system
